# Welcome to my CPIT-490 Final Project

## The Original Idea

### Background:
as a student of the faculty of computing and information technology your having lots of things happening for you in the faculty other than going to classes , each semester you have to wait in (WhatsApp, twitter or college website) for the announcements that they opened the adding and deleting of the subject , after that you have to go to (odes plus) to submit your subject, that’s if you already made your mind but if you didn’t, most likely you will end up having to go with what’s available, which can make you late in the plan of gradation, after adding your subjects you can’t accesses the slides or the syllabus until the semester starts. Witch will make you attend your class without knowing what the subject is all about, if you didn’t understand any point in the class and you wanted to visit the doctor in his office, you have to ask around or look at each door to find the right office. Being a faculty student without joining a WhatsApp group or flowing the faculty twitter account you will most likely never attend any outside courses or events which is frustrating for someone who doesn’t have a twitter account and uses WhatsApp as a personal app. In the end what the student experience in the faculty is always relying on third party sources for any information related to the faculty.

### Method:
From that point what we provide here is an application which help the student with everything related to his experience in the faculty, by providing one reliable source for all information in the faculty. from a map that guide the student around the faculty to a smart schedule which helps the student with his subjects that he has to take, before the announcement for adding and deleting subjects, which will help the student stay in his plan of gradation. Not always wasting time by looking for the information in multiple platforms.
